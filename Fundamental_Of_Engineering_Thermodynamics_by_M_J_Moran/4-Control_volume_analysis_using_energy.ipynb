"//(4.10)   An industrial process discharges gaseous combustion products at 478K, 1 bar with a mass flow rate of 69.78 kg/s. As shown in Fig. E 4.10, a proposed system for utilizing the combustion products combines a heat-recovery steam generator with a turbine. At steady state, combustion products exit the steam generator at 400K, 1 bar and a separate stream of water enters at .275 MPa, 38.9C with a mass flow rate of 2.079 kg/s. At the exit of the turbine, the pressure is 0.07 bars and the quality is 93%. Heat transfer from the outer surfaces of the steam generator and turbine can be ignored, as can the changes in kinetic and potential energies of the flowing streams. There is no significant pressure drop for the water flowing through the steam generator. The combustion products can be modeled as air as an ideal gas. (a) Determine the power developed by the turbine, in kJ/s. (b) Determine the turbine inlet temperature, in C.\n",
