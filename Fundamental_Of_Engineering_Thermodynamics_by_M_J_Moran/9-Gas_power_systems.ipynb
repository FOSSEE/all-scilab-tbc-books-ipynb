"//(9.11)  A regenerative gas turbine with intercooling and reheat operates at steady state. Air enters the compressor at 100 kPa, 300 K with a mass flow rate of 5.807 kg/s. The pressure ratio across the two-stage compressor is 10. The pressure ratio across the two-stage turbine is also 10. The intercooler and reheater each operate at 300 kPa. At the inlets to the turbine stages, the temperature is 1400 K. The temperature at the inlet to the second compressor stage is 300 K. The isentropic efficiency of each compressor and turbine stage is 80%. The regenerator effectiveness is 80%.

Air expands through the turbine, which has an isentropic efficiency of 88%, to a pressure of 100 kPa. The air then passes through the interconnecting heat exchanger and is finally discharged at 400 K. Steam enters the turbine of the vapor power cycle at 8 MPa, 400C, and expands to the condenser pressure of 8 kPa. Water enters the pump as saturated liquid at 8 kPa.
