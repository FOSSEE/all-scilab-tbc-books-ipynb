"// (3.9)  Two tanks are connected by a valve. One tank contains 2 kg of carbon monoxide gas at 77C and 0.7 bar. The other tank holds 8 kg of the same gas at 27C and 1.2 bar. The valve is opened and the gases are allowed to mix while receiving energy byheat transfer from the surroundings. The final equilibrium temperature is 42C. Using the ideal gas model, determine (a) the final equilibrium pressure, in bar (b) the heat transfer for the process, in kJ.\n",
