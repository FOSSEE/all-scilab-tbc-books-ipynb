"//(7.10)  A cogeneration system consists of a natural gas-fueled boiler and a steam turbine that develops power and provides steam for an industrial process. At steady state, fuel enters the boiler with an exergy rate of 100 MW. Steam exits the boiler at 50 bar, 466C with an exergy rate of 35 MW. Steam exits the turbine at 5 bar, 205C and a mass flow rate of 26.15 kg/s. The unit cost of the fuel is 1.44 cents per kw.h  of exergy. The costs of owning and operating the boiler and turbine are, respectively, dollar 1080/h and dollar 92/h. The feedwater and combustion air enter with negligible exergy and cost. The combustion products are discharged directly to the surroundings with negligible cost. Heat transfer with the surroundings and kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible. Let T0 = 298 K. (a) For the turbine, determine the power and the rate exergy exits with the steam, each in MW. (b) Determine the unit costs of the steam exiting the boiler, the steam exiting the turbine, and the power, each in cents per kw.h of exergy. (c) Determine the cost rates of the steam exiting the turbine and the power, each in $/h.\n",
