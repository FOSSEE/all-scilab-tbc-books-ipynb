"//(6.8)     Components of a heat pump for supplying heated air to a dwelling are shown in the schematic below. At steady state, Refrigerant 22 enters the compressor at -5C, 3.5 bar and is compressed adiabatically to 75C, 14 bar. From the compressor, the refrigerant passes through the condenser, where it condenses to liquid at 28C, 14 bar. The refrigerant then expands through a throttling valve to 3.5 bar. The states of the refrigerant are shown on the accompanying Tâ€“s diagram. Return air from the dwelling enters the condenser at 20C, 1 bar with a volumetric flow rate of 0.42 m3/s and exits at 50C with a negligible change in pressure. Using the ideal gas model for the air and neglecting kinetic and potential energy effects, (a) determine the rates of entropy production, in kW/K, for control volumes enclosing the condenser, compressor, and expansion valve, respectively. (b) Discuss the sources of irreversibility in the components considered in part (a).\n",
